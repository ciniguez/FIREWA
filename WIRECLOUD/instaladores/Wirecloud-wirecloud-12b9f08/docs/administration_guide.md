## Administration commands

WireCloud provides a set of command line tools that can be used from the command
line (manually or by scripts) on the folder of the WireCloud instance.

### addtocatalogue

Adds one or more packaged mashable application components into the catalogue. At
least one of the following flags:

- **redeploy**
  Replace mashable application components files with the new ones.
- **users**=USERS
  Comma separated list of users that will obtain access to the uploaded mashable
  application components
- **groups**=GROUPS
  Comma separated list of groups that will obtain access rights to the uploaded
  mashable application components
- **public**
  Allow any user to access the mashable application components.

Example usage:

	$ python manage.py addtocatalogue --users=admin,ringo file1.wgt file2.wgt


### changepassword

Allows changing a userâ€™s password. It prompts you to enter twice the password of the user given as parameter. If they both match, the new password will be changed immediately. If you do not supply a user, the command will attempt to change the password whose username matches the current user.

Example usage:

	$ python manage.py changepassword ringo


### createsuperuser

Creates a superuser account (a user who has all permissions). This is useful if you need to create an initial superuser account or if you need to programmatically generate superuser accounts for your site(s).

When run interactively, this command will prompt for a password for the new superuser account. When run non-interactively, no password will be set, and the superuser account will not be able to log in until a password has been manually set for it.

- **--noinput**
  Tells Django to NOT prompt the user for input of any kind. You must use **--username** with **--noinput**, along with an option for any other required field. Superusers created with **--noinput** will not be able to sign in until they're given a valid password.
- **--username**
  Specifies the login for the superuser.
- **--email**
  Specifies the email for the superuser.

The username and email address for the new account can be supplied by using the **--username** and **--email** arguments on the command line. If either of those is not supplied, `createsuperuser` will prompt for it when running interactively.

Example usage:

	$ python manage.py createsuperuser


### resetsearchindexes

Rebuilds whoosh indexes used by the search engine of WireCloud. Some commonly used options are:

- **noinput**
  Do NOT prompt the user for input of any kind.
- **indexes**=INDEXES
  Comma separated list of indexes to reset. Current available indexes: user, group and resource. All by default.

Example usage:

	$ python manage.py resetsearchindexes --noinput --indexes=user,group


## Creating WireCloud backups and restoring them

1. Create a backup of your instance folder. For example:

        $ tar -cvjf wirecloud-backup.tar.bz2 -C /path/to/your/instance .

2. Create a backup of your database.

There are several ways for creating backups of the data stored in the database
used by WireCloud, each of them with its advantages and disadvantages.

> **NOTE:** Always stop WireCloud before creating a backup for ensuring data
> consistency.

### Database backups using Django

Django provides the `dumpdata` and `loaddata` commands that can be used for
creating and restoring backups. Those commands can be used independently of the
database engine used. Moreover, you can create those backups using a given
database engine and restore them using a different one. Run the following
command for creating a backup of your database using Django:

    $ python manage.py dumpdata > wirecloud.backup

For restoring the backup you only have to run the `loaddata` command, using a
clean database:

    $ python manage.py loaddata wirecloud.backup

> **Note**: Backups created using `dumpdata` can only be restored using the same
> WireCloud version used for creating the backup. If you need to use a different
> version, restore the backup using the original version and then
> upgrade/downgrade it.


### SQLite3 database backups

Creating a backup of a SQLite3 database is as easy as creating a copy of the
file where the database is stored. The only thing to take into account is to
stop WireCloud before creating the copy to avoid possible inconsistences.

The restoration procedure is as easy as the creation, you only have to make
WireCloud use the copied database file by editing the `settings.py` file or by
moving the copied database file to the place expected by WireCloud.

> **NOTE**: Take into account that this means that if you are making a full
> backup of your WireCloud instance, you don't need an extra step for
> backing up the database, this backup is already performed by backing up
> the instance directory.

### PostgreSQL database backups

You can find more informatio about how to create PostgreSQL backups in this
[page](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/backup-dump.html). Basically,
you have to run the following command:

    $ pg_dump <dbname> > wirecloud.backup

> Make sure WireCloud is not running before making the backup

You can restore the backup using the following command:

    $ psql <dbname> < wirecloud.backup


## Upgrading from previous versions

1. Install the new version of WireCloud
2. Migrate the database, collect the new static files and create the compressed
versions of the JavaScript and CSS files by running the following command:

        $ python manage.py syncdb --migrate; python manage.py collectstatic --noinput; python manage.py compress --force

3. Reload WireCloud (e.g. `$ service apache2 graceful`)


## From 0.7.x to 0.8.x

### Migrate from `django-social-auth` to `python-social-auth`

WireCloud 0.8.x migrated FIWARE IdM code to use `python-social-auth` instead of
using `django-social-auth` due to the later being deprecated. Please, follow
these instructions if you are using the IdM integration:

1. Install `python-social-auth` (e.g. `pip install python-social-auth`)
2. Edit your `settings.py` making the following changes:
    1. replace `social_auth` with `social.apps.django_app.default` in the
    `INSTALLED_APPS` setting
    2. replace `wirecloud.fiware.social_auth_backend.FiwareBackend` with
    `wirecloud.fiware.social_auth_backend.FIWAREOAuth2` in the
    `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting.
    3. rename `FIWARE_APP_ID` to `SOCIAL_AUTH_FIWARE_KEY` and
    `FIWARE_APP_SECRET` to `SOCIAL_AUTH_FIWARE_SECRET`
3. Edit your `urls.py` file and replace:

    ```python
        url(r'', include('social_auth.urls')),
    ```

    with

    ```python
        url('', include('social.apps.django_app.urls', namespace='social'))
    ```

4. Fake `python-social-auth` migrations (it uses the same dabase schema than `django-social-auth`):

    ```
    python manage.py migrate default --fake
    ```

5. Now you can remove django-social-auth :). E.g.:

    ```
    pip uninstall django-social-auth
    ```

### Migrate the user search index

WireCloud 0.8.2 updated the information stored in the user search index, so you
should run the following command for updating this index:

```
python manage.py resetsearchindexes --indexes=user
```

## From 0.6.x to 0.7.x

WireCloud 0.7.x adds support for using Whoosh indexes for searching, as
WireCloud 0.6.x didn't use Whoosh, you need to run an extra step when migrating
from 0.6.x to 0.7.x for creating a initial version of those indexes:

    $ python manage.py resetsearchindexes
